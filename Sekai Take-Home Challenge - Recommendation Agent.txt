Sekai Take-Home Challenge
Build a tiny squad of AI agents that learns to recommend the right stories to the right fans—exactly what you’ll do with us in production!
________________


1 / Mission
Write code that iterates on a recommendation prompt until it consistently picks 10 highly-relevant Sekai stories for a user, given:
* 5 sample Sekai stories (below).
Use these as seed data—expand to ≈ 100 stories with an LLM of your choice.

* 5 full user profiles (below).
Use them as ground truth examples and synthesize additional test users as needed.

You’re free to choose any multi-agent framework, model stack, or hosting setup.

2 / High-level Flow to Implement
Agent
	Purpose
	Model Guidance
	Prompt-Optimizer
	Proposes prompt tweaks based on prior evaluations.
	Any model you like.
	Recommendation Agent
	Returns 10 story IDs for a simulated new user. Must be fast.
	Gemini 2.0 Flash (or an equivalently speedy “no-thinking” model).
	Evaluation Agent
	1. Read a full user profile.
2. Simulates the tags that user would tick on Sekai’s first screen.
3. Feeds those simulated tags to the Recommendation Agent.
4. Computes an eval score against “ground-truth” recommendations produced directly from the full profile.
	Gemini 2.5 Pro or a comparable SOTA reasoning-heavy model from OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
	

Orchestrate them in an autonomous loop: optimize → recommend → evaluate → feedback → repeat until you hit a self-chosen score or time budget.
________________


3 / Ground Truth & Scoring
   * Ground-truth list: Ask your Evaluation Agent to recommend directly from the full profile + full story pool.

   * Metric: Pick something sensible (e.g., precision@10, mean-recall, semantic overlap). Tell us why.

   * Target: Stop when your metric plateaus or time runs out.

5 / Minimum Deliverables
      1. Git repo (any language) with a one-command demo.

      2. README or brief doc covering:

         * architecture & agent roles

         * caching strategy (embed & prompt caches)

         * evaluation metric & stopping rule

         * how you’d scale to production volumes

            3. Log/table showing ≥ 3 optimization cycles with their eval scores.

            4. ≤ 5-minute Loom/YouTube walk-through (optional but appreciated).

6 / Review Criteria
               * Architectural clarity – is the agent loop clean & extensible?

               * Product intuition – do metric and ground-truth method make sense for Sekai?

               * Code quality & docs – can we run it in one go?

               * Result quality – do the final 10 picks actually fit the user? Runtime & token cost?

Have fun, iterate boldly, and show us how you think. We can’t wait to see your agents in action! 🎉
